#Welcome!

To work with this code, you will need to be able to compile [these tools](https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki/wiki/Toolchain).

To work with c++ you will need to check out a different version of the crosstool-ng codebase: 

```git clone -b lx106-g++ git://github.com/jcmvbkbc/crosstool-NG.git```

The code that is currently in the system is dependent on the Arduino library, so make sure that is installed as well. 

./ct-ng menuconfig
